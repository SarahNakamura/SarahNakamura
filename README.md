## Hi there, thank you for Sarah's user guideðŸ‘‹

### About me
Hello, I am SarahNakamura. I am currenty studying bioinformatics and I love learning new things and exploring the unknowns!!! - which sort of leads to my passion towards reseach... Decoding the genetic/genomic data to understand disease progression mechanism is something I have been interested in through my research journey and would like to continue to pursue this passion in as a PhD student in the future. 
### What does my work style look like...
I like to plan things ahead of time so my calender consists of time blocks to designate that timeframe to focus on tasks. I am a morning person because it lets me have a peaceful time with a cup of coffee in my hand and prepare for the day!
When it comes to working, I like to ask questions whenever I am not sure of things, so I enjoy working in an opn environment where people get get to ask questions without hesitation.
### How to contact me
Either email or slack works best for me. I usually respond pretty quickly if not less than 24hrs. 
### My value
I am a lifelong learner. Learning new things could take some time, but I think it's super fun! I love being challenged and that is one of the ways I find passion in whatever I do.
### My Strenghth and Weaknesses
Strength - I have a good memory when it comes to task management. So I will most likely remember where the project is at and what tasks are required to move forward.
Weakness -  I tend to fill up my calender to the brim... So, balancing my schedule and understanding my limit is something I am working on.
### Fun facts about me!
Running is one of the things I love doing because it lets me destress and organize what is in my mind. One of my life goals is to run a full marathon and perhaps make it to the Boston marathon (we shall see...) I have also been playing the clarinet for over 12 years and am a part of the symphonic wind ensemble! I love when there is an instant click in the music and the harmony sounds really good!! - I get goose bumps everytime when it happens. Coffee is another thing I love! Whenever I travel and visit new places, I like to go to local coffee shops and try their seasonal specials:))
